# PHP MVC practice
17.2.2022
as youtuber Quick Programmer teach it. 

It has big secure concerns like not encrypted passwords, and it has not tested.
But it was an interesting way to learn classes and mvc in PHP
It is open when I read/ hear / see how Laracast's Jeff Way teach it. 

So do not use it in production or anyway near World Wide Web.

As I said, I want to compare it other ways to do the same thing: to have router and authorization.
